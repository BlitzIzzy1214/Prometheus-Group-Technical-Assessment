### JsonPlaceholderTests

This test suite tests the [JSONPlaceholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/) API. Specifically, it focuses on testing the available routes for the User object. There are multiple tests covering the HTTP request methods of GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, and DELETE. Some cases are failing as a result of how JSONPlaceholder is designed to return fake response data and not truly update its own database, but in a real world scenario they would likely pass. The PATCH test ran and passed on the initial run, but has since given 5XX HTTP codes. There are also some warnings for null objects, however these objects are checked immediately for potential null values.



### PlaywrightTests

This test suite tests using Playwright with C# to traverse from Google to Prometheus Group's website in order to attempt to make an invalid submission on the Contact Us page. An additional .txt file is available with raw code generated by codegen showing the process used.
